## Northcoders News Web App

This portfolio project was developed as part of my second project during my training at Northcoders, combining frontend with the backend API which is hosted on Render: https://nc-news-project-1-zm9p.onrender.com/api. 

I completed this project over 5 days, using React, Vite and Bootstrap.

Hosted app link on Netlify: https://nc-news-alex.netlify.app
Note: The API is hosted on the free version of Render, which may experience initial loading delays due to inactivity

The project is designed to simulate a news application where users can view, interact with, and manage articles and comments.
