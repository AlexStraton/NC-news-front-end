## Northcoders News Web App

This portfolio project was developed as part of my journey in web development, combining frontend and backend skills acquired during my training at [Northcoders]. I completed this project over 7 days, building upon foundational knowledge in full-stack web development.

The project is designed to simulate a news application where users can view, interact with, and manage articles and comments.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This portfolio project was created as part of a Digital Skills Bootcamp in Software Engineering provided by [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com/)
